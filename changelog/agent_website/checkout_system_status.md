# Checkout System Status Report
**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Issue Resolved:** Fatal error in checkout.php due to column mismatch

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
- Fatal error: `Unknown column 'p.product_image' in 'field list'`
- The `tbl_products` table uses `image_url` column, not `product_image`

### **Root Cause:**
- Database table structure inconsistency between expected and actual column names
- The checkout system was looking for `p.product_image` but the table has `image_url`

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed SQL Queries**: Updated all queries to use `p.image_url as product_image`
2. **Added Sample Data**: Inserted 4 automotive products for testing
3. **Verified Database Structure**: Confirmed all tables have correct relationships
