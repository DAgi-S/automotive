## Task Summary
Customized all main database connection files to support both local development and hosted server environments. The connection logic now automatically selects the correct credentials based on the server environment (localhost vs. production at natiautomotive.com).

## Production Credentials Used
- Host: localhost (or hosting DB host)
- Database: automotive
- Username: nati
- Password: Nati-0911

## Local Credentials Used
- Host: localhost
- Database: automotive2
- Username: root
- Password: (empty)

## Files Updated
- partial-front/db_con.php
- ecommerce/includes/db_con.php
- admin/partial-fronts/db_con.php

## Approach
- Used `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` to detect environment.
- Applied credentials accordingly in both class-based and procedural connection files.
- Ensured all connection logic is now environment-aware and secure.
