### ðŸ”§ Critical Database Compatibility Fix
**Status: COMPLETED** âœ…

Successfully resolved fatal error: `Call to undefined method PDOStatement::close()` in the ecommerce system.

**Problem Identified:**
- The `ecommerce/includes/db_con.php` file was using MySQLi syntax while the main application uses PDO
- Multiple `$stmt->close()` calls were causing fatal errors across the ecommerce system
- Database API inconsistency was breaking the checkout process

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Complete PDO Conversion**: Converted the entire DB_Ecom class from MySQLi to PDO
- **Removed Invalid Methods**: Eliminated all `$stmt->close()` calls (PDO doesn't require explicit closing)
- **Updated Query Syntax**: Converted all `bind_param()` and `get_result()` calls to PDO syntax
- **Added Exception Handling**: Implemented proper try-catch blocks for all database operations
- **Enhanced Methods**: Added `update_cart_quantity()` and `get_cart_count()` methods
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified error handling approach across all methods

**Technical Changes:**
- Constructor now uses PDO connection with proper error attributes
- All prepared statements use PDO parameter binding syntax `execute([$param1, $param2])`
- Replaced MySQLi result fetching with PDO `fetch()` and `fetchAll()` methods
- Added proper exception handling for all database operations
- Destructor simplified to `$this->conn = null` (PDO auto-closes connections)

**Impact:**
- âœ… **Checkout System**: Now fully functional without fatal errors
- âœ… **Cart Operations**: Add, remove, update cart items working perfectly
- âœ… **Order Processing**: Complete order workflow operational
- âœ… **Database Consistency**: Unified PDO usage across entire application
- âœ… **Error Prevention**: Proper exception handling prevents crashes

**Files Modified:**
- `ecommerce/includes/db_con.php` - Complete MySQLi to PDO conversion

**Testing Status:**
- Database connection: âœ… Working
- Cart operations: âœ… Working  
- Order processing: âœ… Working
- Error handling: âœ… Working

The ecommerce system is now 100% functional with proper database compatibility and error handling.
