To add an amazing animated hero section with cars, technicians, and maintenance visuals without affecting the rest of your project, you can use a dedicated hero-section.php partial and include it in your homepage (index.php) using PHP. You‚Äôll also use Lottie animations, parallax effects, or AOS (Animate on Scroll) to keep performance high and layout modular.
‚úÖ Step-by-Step Strategy:

    Create a separate file for the hero section to isolate changes:

        includes/hero-section.php

    Use Lottie or animated SVGs for cars and technicians

        Use lightweight animations from https://lottiefiles.com

        Add animated car repair scene or spinning wrench

    Add scroll-triggered or hover animations

        Use AOS or GSAP for fade-in, slide, or zoom effects

    Include the hero section in your homepage (index.php):

    <?php include 'includes/hero-section.php'; ?>

Add an animated hero section for the homepage of Nati Automotive. This section should be created as a separate PHP partial (`includes/hero-section.php`) and include the following:

1. A full-width hero area with:
   - A dark automotive background
   - A Lottie animation or animated SVG showing a car getting repaired or a mechanic working
   - Catchy headline: ‚ÄúDrive Better. Drive Protected.‚Äù
   - Subheadline: ‚ÄúExpert Car Repair & Maintenance Services You Can Trust.‚Äù
   - A glowing call-to-action button: ‚ÄúBook a Service‚Äù

2. Use Lottie for car/mechanic animations. Make sure it‚Äôs responsive and optimized for fast load.

3. Add AOS.js (Animate On Scroll) to fade-in the text and button from the left.

4. Ensure all styles go inside `style.css` under a `.hero-section` class.

5. Don‚Äôt affect the layout or scripts of other parts of the site. Encapsulate all JS/CSS related to this section.

6. In `index.php`, include the hero section using:
```php
<?php include 'includes/hero-section.php'; ?>
