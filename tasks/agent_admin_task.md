# Task for agent_admin

## Assignment
You are responsible for all admin-related modules and features in the Automotive project. This includes:
- Managing the admin dashboard and its components
- Handling admin authentication, roles, and permissions
- Overseeing admin-side CRUD operations (users, articles, packages, etc.)
- Maintaining admin-specific UI/UX

## Rules
- Do not work on API, ecommerce, frontend, documentation, or assets tasks.
- Do not modify files outside the admin module unless strictly necessary for admin functionality.
- Log all changes in your own changelog.

## Notes
- Fixed order print preview to show car brand/model names, not IDs. Updated SQL join logic in get_order_details.php to use tbl_info only and fallback to raw car_model if needed. (2024-06-22)
